Professional Summary
====================

Decades of experience with the software development life cycle have
uniquely prepared me to fulfill many different roles. I've seen great
success, tempered by failure and many lessons learned, while working
as a web application developer and system operator. Forever grateful
for excellent management training early in my career, but actively
seeking opportunity as an architect or individual contributor.

Having tended to every level of the application stack, my focus has
historically specialized around systems integration and automation.
I am actively engaged in development efforts which fully embrace deep
introspection, frank discussion, and deliberate action. Iterating to
realize awesome solutions can be difficult work, but building systems
utilizing free and open standards, development models, and licensing
presents exciting opportunities for collaboration and learning.
