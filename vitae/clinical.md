Counselor | Experience Designer | Facilitator | Implementation Architect | Mentor | Semantics Specialist


Professional Profile
--------------------

Having sunset decades of experience devoted to software development, I am forever grateful for excellent management training early in that career.  Whether working in person as a solutions architect, remotely as an individual contributor, or semi-privately interviewing in a sea of desks at a call center, the transferrable skills I bring into therapeutic relationship are supported by a depth of personal experience integrating the wisdom of cross-functional teams, including perspective gained through self-advocacy with regard to intersecting forms of marginalization and disability.  Iterative work, keen observation, justice orientation, continuous introspection, frank discussion, and deliberate action all remain central to how I show up in any setting.

Professional Skills
-------------------

__Leadership for Equity__

 * Builds coalitions with emphasis on centering marginalized team members to address unmet needs and ensure collective success
 * Offers counsel and mentorship to individuals seeking help with effectively integrating group processes and agreements
 * Collaborates to co-create accessible environments, advocating for inclusion while improving productivity and job satisfaction
 * Analyzes existing processes with an ability to creatively synthesize opportunities and envision alternatives to surface options for mutually beneficial paths forward
 * Stands in solidarity with several marginalized identities, holds epistemic privilege regarding intersectional experience, and fosters deeply inclusive collaborations


__Broaching for Healing__

 * Quickly recognizes the unspoken, often uncomfortable or shameful, shadow parts present in any given system or group
 * Practices on a continuum of conflict resolution options from calling on, to calling in, to eventually calling out problematic experience
 * Holds firm to confidential and contemplative exploration of sensitive topics, continually seeking and affirming consent
 * Polls for resonance with topics relevant to systemic or internalized oppression while helping to make conscious the unconsious
 * Asks tough questions while suspending disbelief and judgement, listening deeply in search of mutual understanding
 

__Holds Cognitive Dissonance__

 * Identifies opportunity to collaborate with disparate groups in promoting goals of innovation and expansion of awareness
 * Frequently, when located beyond unrelatable binary options, exceeds known expectations while maintaining contradictory perspective
 * Consistent mindfulness practice enables powerful presencing and tracking skills in a variety of environments, using various objects of meditation
 * Accesses vast mental maps with a focus on elements of data as well as singular features while considering the impacts of each on larger ecosystems
 * Considers diverse experiences and needs of others when selecting or designing interventions for the most profound impact

 
__Deeply Attentive__

 * Seeks confirmation of observations and deductions, often drawing attention to overlooked features or unmet needs
 * Considers listening a whole-body engagement of the sensory field, with a focused attunement on others in relationship
 * Effectively manages complications of monotropic focus in environments demanding partitioned application of attention
 * Excels in depth of exploration on any given area of focus, engaging fully with contextual and environmental subtleties
 * Empties the cup and presents with a beginner's mind whenever appropriate, without hesitation or embarassment


__Committed to Activism__

 * Acknowledges location often granted privilege, and openly discusses complexity as an advantaged other
 * Speaks truth to power, directly and indirectly, via engagement with broaching or coaching as needed
 * Eschews pathology and biomedical models of psychological distress in favor of neurodiversity paradigm
 * Centers social justice and trauma informed practice over methodologies bypassing systemic influences
 * Builds coalitions and works to surface emergent issues resident in exploration of group intelligence
