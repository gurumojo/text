Curriculum Vitae
================

A summarized collection of professional experience


Cover Letter
------------

I'm not writing typical letters to prospective employers any more.  In fact, I'm
refusing requests based on things said to be normal at first glance.  Why...?  I
have sought after skills, patience, knowledge, decades of experience, a proven
track record of teamwork as well as innovative solo contributions and ... I'm
not normal.


While interviewing each of my last few managers one important question was posed
(see number 7 below).  Each time the inquiry garnered only lies in reply.  I say
this boldly because none of those teams focused on building the individuals who
comprised the membership of juggernauts shipping value biweekly.

Surely, I'm exaggerating...?!  I sincerely wish that were true.


Having faced unexplained rejection just after delivering on entirely unrealistic
expectations in every forum over decades of searching for a place I truly fit in
and receive much needed support has revealed this system accepted via silence of
the privileged works precisely as intended.  As such the have nots keep on not
having regardless of morals, habits, effort, luck, or any other nonsensical
conclusion drawn within contexts designed solely to extract value from others'
labor while disallowing a seat at the table as peers in decision making.  While
accommodations guaranteed by rule of law continue to be flouted by those with
such narrow views, calling equitable treatment preferential due to ignorance or
bias, I will remain dedicated to breaking down walls built by privileged.

I realize broadcasting this perspective may be seen as risky or ill-advised by
most in my peer network.  That is precisely the fear based position I seek to
eliminate, so I'll conclude with questions that focus discussion on important
topics centered in the context of levelling the playing field and truly mutual
benefit.  I look forward to your answers!

As a multi-decade veteran of the software development industry, demands for free
