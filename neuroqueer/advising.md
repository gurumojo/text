   * those without capacity for engagement in direct actions or especially in need of aide
 * self-advocacy, what, how, who, when...?

 * coalitions across SUN groups could open up interesting opportunities
 * provide space for empowering oneself while learning to express needs
 * step into intersectionality and eliminate performative inclusivity

Guiding Principles

 * is the vanity zoom link accomodating any other needs?
 * where should we focus written collaboration?  (varied security implications)
 * how is the digital tooling accompanying the group best used (if at all)?
