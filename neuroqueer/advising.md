Neuroqueer Advising
===================

Questions for professors responsive to the call:

 * What experience do you have advising student groups?
 * Do you know of / are you open to / advising teams for these groups?
 * If another professor was available, would you prefer to yield the position?
 * What does queering the status quo look like from your perspective?
