Neuroqueer All The Things!
==========================

When one endeavors to neuroqueer, they step beyond the neurodiversity paradigm
into exploration of liberation theory and the transcendence of identity politics.
Interest in queering the status quo is all that stands prerequisite to holding
neuroqueer as an identity in contexts where such reference is deemed necessary.

Anyone reading this is encouraged to contribute your support and/or presence via
radical acceptance and action promoting inclusive practices throughout our
communities.  Nihil de nobis sine nobis.
