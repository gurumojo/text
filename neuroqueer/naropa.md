Neuroqueer Naropa
=================

Stepping beyond the neurodiversity paradigm and into exploration of liberation theory, the Neuroqueer Naropa group meets weekly to hold space for emergent topics relevant to accessibility advocacy, coalition building, education resources, hidden disabilities, institutional responsibility, organizing for change, and even social stimming.  Anyone with a neurodivergent diagnosis, questioning whether to pursue diagnosis, self-identified neurodivergence, seeking to transcend identity politics, or simply interested in queering the status quo is encouraged to contribute your support and/or presence via radical acceptance and action promoting inclusive practices on campus and throughout our communities.  Nihil de nobis sine nobis.
