Neurodiversity
==============

[Normal variation in the human genome](https://www.diversitystyleguide.com/glossary/neurodiversity/)
affecting any or all mental functions including but not limited to attention,
emotional regulation, learning, sensory processing, etc.


Pathologization
---------------

Autistic activists rejected the notion of autism as a disability when they
coined the term [neurodiversity](./glossary.md#neurodiversity) during the
[early 1990s](https://twitter.com/WalkerSensei/status/1512643383088410627),
instead favoring a perspective embracing different ways brains process
information.  As this important shift in thinking has spread around the world it
undercuts medical industry specific framing of how people are disabled and
supports a model which defines disability in a social context where work is
required of abled people to achieve inclusion and equitable treatment for all.
[Ontological negation](https://twitter.com/alexhaagaard/status/1402089497123344387),
unfortunately for neurodivergents, is the actual goal of much of the current
misguided effort in autism advocacy as well as the politics of medicine.


Resolution
----------

Check out [Neurotribes](https://neurotribes.com/) from author
[Steve Silberman](https://twitter.com/stevesilberman) for the entire bedraggled
history of oppression and [misanthropy](./glossary.md#misanthropy) over the
roughly 80 years autistics have been known to the medical establishment.
Suffice it to say, many fitting this diagnosis prefer to look upon it as an
identity as opposed to a disorder or a disease.  Many of those same people share
similar experiences of being [othered](./glossary.md#othered) and shouted over
when it came time to decide how they were going to access aide or describe their
own unique needs.  Many of them were in fact tortured, denied any agency or the
basic human right of communication.

Parents' self-centered suffering over imagined lost possibilities for the ideal
neurotypical children they desired is the only possible focus when we consider
continually mounting cases of [filicide](./glossary.md#filicide).  For those
surviving childhood, provisions for accomodation are so often reported as too
onerous for [allistic](./glossary.md#allistic) people (if it is indeed
considered at all).  If one were lucky enough to obtain access beyond
gatekeepers of diagnosis and resources so often denied to anyone except young
white boys, they would still have to battle against incessant claims of
favoritism or direct manipulation via gaslighting and tone policing.  For any
born during the
[lost generation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8415774/), before
regular screening for [neurodivergence](./glossary.md#neurodivergent) was
commonplace among school children, late life self-identification and/or
diagnosis following burnout is often the only path to understanding of the
reasons they've struggled so mightily to avoid joblessness and suicide.  Digital
community is often their only refuge from bigotry and/or resource in discovery.


Discussion
----------

In what was only the beginning of this awakening we continue to witness, as
communities redefine themselves using digital tooling through the 2010s and
beyond, I've felt the undeniable tug from my future self refusing to let me
rest though weary.  When I wasn't working over the course of the early 2020s I
was most likely recovering from what little work I was able to accomplish.  My
physical downtime was enforced by yet undiagnosed chronic condition(s) flaring
throughout what I now recognize as another [autistic burnout](./burnout.md).
When it didn't coincide with mental fatigue it allowed time to read voluminous
research and personal accounts and network with other neurodivergents on similar
paths to discovery.  I did more reading in one year than was required for my
entire undergraduate degree, and my interest is only piquing as I continue
learning how to wield my abilities and manage previously unrecognized deficits.
My native [hyperfocused](./glossary.md#hyperfocus) and [autodidactic](./glossary.md#autodidact)
learning style flourished without constraint!

I'd love some feedback on my writing on related topics to date, as I find the
advocacy I'm naturally drawn to (and already learning to protect myself from)
that much more needed with each new lesson learned.  Did you find the
[glossary](./glossary.md 'Definition List') helpful?  Does my understanding jibe
with your experience?


Advocacy
--------

I am an Autistic Bisexual Nonbinary Nordic with a Beard (e.g.
[cis](./glossary.md#cisgender) [masc](./glossary.md#masculine)
[white](./glossary.md#white) [passing](./glossary.md#passing)) with historically
low support needs.  Translation: metric tons of internalized bias and privilege
forever seeking to overshadow a marginalization trifecta with trauma on top.
One frequently described as a lone wolf, all too often falling prey to the pack,
my spirit animal throughout youth a chameleon.

* [Setting the Stage](./introduction.md)
* [My Flavor of Autism](./diagnosis.md)
* [Intersectionality](./intersectionality.md)
* [Ordered Identity](./identity.md)
* [Lacking Agency](./agency.md)
* [Autistic Burnout](./burnout.md)
* [Emerging Activism](./activism.md)
* [Getting Involved](./engagement.md)

This is, admittedly, a lot to unpack.  My love language is information dumps.
Put more simply and succinctly, the [TL;DR](./glossary.md#TLDR) of it is:

I am an [#autistic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/autistic)
[#bisexual](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bisexual)
[#nonbinary](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nonbinary)
[#nordic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/nordic),
and it is also accurate and acceptable to refer to me as a
[#disabled](https://twitter.com/hashtag/disabled)
[#neurodivergent](https://twitter.com/hashtag/neurodivergent)
[#enby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/enby)
or one possessing [#gurumojo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gurumojo).


Perspective
-----------

I love learning from answers by community members monitoring relevant
[hashtags](./glossary.md#hashtag) on social media.  Above all, I have learned
that in order to be considered an [ally](./glossary.md#ally) of
[marginalized](./glossary.md#marginalize) people one must live and breathe
"nothing about us without us" (nihil de nobis sine nobis) by honoring and
promoting messages of lived experience over the tyranny of observation resulting
in [pathologization](./glossary.md#pathologize).  In the same way that I cannot
speak to the experiences of indiginous people, one cannot simply watch and learn
about autistic experience; one must have it described authentically via open
communication directly from participants using whatever medium they prefer
(e.g. [AAC](./glossary.md#AAC 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication')).
I say this as one completely rediscovered after 44 trips around the nearest
star.  Sorting out all the gaslighting and masking from authentic experience
continues to require wearying effort.

I could not have metamorphosed into my current state while buffered from daily
demands had it not been for the access to resources granted by
[white privilege](./glossary.md#privilege) and my capacity for
[passing](./glossary.md#passing) as straight.  I was allowed time to break down
safely after my own support of repeated family tragedies compounded with nearly
constant [gaslighting](./glossary.md#gaslighting) in professional settings as
well as at home only because I spent everything I had saved (while masking as a
successful software developer).  I lost my house and a decade-plus relationship
but I maintain a very grateful view of the many
[neurodivergent](./glossary.md#neurodivergent) advocates and allies who have
touched my life!
