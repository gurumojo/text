Neurodiversity
==============

[Normal variation in the human genome](https://www.diversitystyleguide.com/glossary/neurodiversity/)
affecting any or all mental functions including but not limited to attention,
emotional regulation, learning, sensory processing, etc.


Pathologisation
---------------

Sociologist Judy Singer rejected the notion of autism as a disability when she
coined the term, instead favoring a perspective embracing different ways brains
process information.  As this important shift in thinking has spread around the
world it undercuts medical industry specific framing of how people are disabled
and supports a model which defines disability in a social context where work is
required of abled people to achieve inclusion and equitable treatment for all.
[Ontological negation](https://twitter.com/alexhaagaard/status/1402089497123344387),
unfortunately for neurodivergents, is the actual goal of much of the current
misguided effort in autism advocacy as well as the politics of medicine.


Resolution
----------

Check out [Neurotribes](https://neurotribes.com/) from author Steve Silberman
for the entire bedraggled history of oppression and misanthropy over the roughly
80 years autistics have been known to the medical establishment.  Suffice it to
say, many fitting this diagnosis prefer to look upon it as an identity as
opposed to a disorder or a disease.  Many of those same people share similar
experiences of being othered and shouted over when it came time to decide how
they were going to access aide or describe their own unique needs.  Many of them
were in fact tortured, denied any agency or the basic human right of
communication.  Parents' self-centered suffering over imagined lost
possibilities for the neurotypical children they desired is the only possible
focus when we consider mounting cases of filicide.  For those surviving
childhood, provisions for accomodation are reported so often as too onerous for
allistic people (if it is considered at all).  If one were lucky enough to
obtain access to valid diagnostic resources so often denied to anyone except
young white boys, they would still have to battle against incessant claims of
favoritism or direct manipulation via gaslighting and tone policing.


Discussion
----------

That was only the beginning of this awakening we are continuing to see unfold
as communities redefine themselves using digital tooling through the 2020s and
beyond.  I've felt the undeniable tug from my future self refusing to let me
rest though weary.  When I wasn't working over the course of the last year I
was most likely recovering from what little work I was able to accomplish.  My
physical downtime, enforced by yet undiagnosed cronic condition(s) flaring
throughout what I now recognize as another [autistic burnout](./burnout.md),
when it didn't coincide with mental fatigue allowed me time to read voluminous
research and personal accounts and network with other neurodivergents on similar
paths to discovery.  I've done more reading this last year than was required
for my entire undergraduate degree, and my interest is only piquing as I
continue learing how to wield my abilities and manage previously unrecognized
deficits.  Hyperfocus and autodidactic nature flourishing without constraint!

I'd love some feedback on my writing on related topics to date, as I find the
advocacy I'm naturally drawn to (and already learning to protect myself from)
that much more needed with each new lesson learned.  Does my understanding jibe
with your experience?


Advocacy
--------

I am an Autistic Bisexual Nonbinary Nordic with a Beard (e.g. cis masc white
passing) with historically low support needs.  Translation: metric tons of
internalised bias and privilege forever seeking to overshadow a marginalization
trifecta with trauma on top.  One frequently described as a lone wolf, all too
often falling prey to the pack, my spirit animal throughout youth a chameleon.

* [Lacking Agency](./agency.md)

This is, admittedly, a lot to unpack.  My love language is information dumps.
Put more simply and succinctly, the TL;DR of it is:

I love learning from answers by community members monitoring these hashtags on
social media.  Above all, to be considered an ally of marginalized people one
must live and breathe "nothing about us without us" (nihil de nobis sine nobis)
by honoring and promoting messages of lived experience over the tyranny of
observation resulting in pathologisation.  In the same way that I cannot speak
to the experiences of Black people, one cannot simply watch and learn about
autistic experience; one must have it described authentically via open
communication directly from participants.  I say this as one newly rediscovered
after 44 trips around the nearest star.  Sorting out all the gaslighting and
masking from authentic experience has been wearying effort.  I could not have
metamorphosed buffered from daily demands had it not been for the access to
resources granted by white privelege allowing time to break down safely after my
own support of repeated family tragedies in recent years compounded with nearly
constant gaslighting in professional settings.  I maintain a grateful view of
neurodivergent allies and advocates!
