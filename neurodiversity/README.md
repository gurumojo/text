Neurodiversity
==============

Normal variation in the human genome affecting any or all mental functions
including but not limited to attention, emotional regulation, learning, etc.


Pathologisation
---------------

Sociologist Judy Singer rejected the notion of autism as a disability, instead
favoring a perspective embracing different ways brains process information. As
this important shift in thinking has spread around the world it undercuts
medical industry specific framing of how people are disabled and supports a
model which defines disability in a social context (e.g. ontological purge is
the actual goal of much of the current misguided effort in re autistic people).


Resolution
----------

Check out Neurotribes from author Steve Silberman for the entire bedraggled
history of oppression and misanthropy over the roughly 80 years autistics have
been known to exist.  Suffice it to say, many fitting this diagnosis prefer to
look upon it as an identity as opposed to a disorder or a disease.  Many of
those same people share similar experiences of being othered and shouted over
when it came time to decide how they were going to access aide.  Many of them
were in fact tortured, denied the basic human right of communication; providing
accomodations is reported so often as too onerous for allistic people (if it is
considered at all, and especially *if* they were lucky enough to have access to
valid diagnostic resources so often denied to anyone except young white boys).


Discussion
----------

That was only the beginning of this awakening we are continuing to see unfold
as communities redefine themselves using digital tooling through the 2020s and
beyond.  I've felt the undeniable tug from my future self refusing to let me
rest though weary.  When I wasn't working over the course of the last year I
was most likely recovering from what little work I was able to accomplish.  My
physical downtime, enforced by yet undiagnosed cronic condition(s) flaring
throughout what I now recognize as (at least my 2nd) [autistic burnout](./autistic-burnout.md),
when it didn't coincide with mental fatigue allowed me time to read voluminous
research and personal accounts and network with other tribefolk on similar
paths to discovery.  I've done more reading this last year than was required
for my entire undergraduate degree, and my interest is only piquing as I
continue learing how to weild my abilities and manage previously unrecognized
deficits.  Hyperfocus and autodidactic nature flourishing without constraint!

I'd love some feedback on my writing on related topics to date, as I find the
advocacy I'm naturally drawn to (and already learning to protect myself from)
that much more needed with each new lesson learned.  Does my understanding jibe
with your experience?


Advocacy
--------

I am an Autistic Bisexual Non-Binary Nordic with a Beard in Oregon (e.g. cis
masc white passing foodie) with historically low support needs.  Translation:
metric tons of internalised bias and privilege forever seeking to overshadow a
marginalization trifecta with trauma on top.  One frequently described as a lone
wolf, all too often falling prey to the pack, my sprit animal throughout youth a
chameleon.

This is, admittedly, a lot to unpack.  My love language is information dumps.
Put more simply and succinctly:

I am #ActuallyAutistic
I am #AutisticAF
I am #Autistic

I believe all people deserve #CommunicationFirst so #IStandWithNonspeakers.  I
love it when I learn from answers by community members monitoring Twitter for
#AskingAutistics inquiries.  Above all, to be considered an ally one must live
and breathe the "nothing about us without us" ethos, always honoring messages of
lived experience over the tyranny of observation resulting in pathologisation.
One cannot watch and learn about autistic experience; one must have it described
authentically via open communication directly from participants.
