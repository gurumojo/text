Autism Self Test
================

Individual identification (often referred to as self-diagnosis) as autistic is
valid;  lived experience repeatedly proves out over pathologisation

Medical vs. Social
------------------

I am continually finding myself agog at the ways people gatekeep and block
access in order to maintain a semblance of control in any given situation.
Breaking down barriers raised by ongoing oppression driven by the mindless
pursuit of capitalist goals is tiresome, for many even debilitating, work.
As application of scientific methods of study yield discoveries and ratify
growing number of voices raised in opposition to neurotypical normalization,
hate and ignorance must be vigilantly guarded against and fought directly
whenever possible.

The most often cited arguments used to silence autistic voices depend upon
logical fallicies and innattention from their audiences.  Without providing
[AAC](https://aaccommunity.net/ccc/aac-aac/) (augmentative and alternative
communication) to nonspeaking autistics, they are secluded, tortured, and even
killed by family described in popular media almost heroically (e.g. having
succumbed to the oppression of responsibility to one needing accomodations
passing through spaces designed in ways often directly contrary to their
personal needs) while refused the most basic of human rights (communication,
autonomy, etc.).

Those battling apraxia, dysarthria, aphasia, developmental disabilities, or
traumatic brain injures need better support than the narrow focus so painfully
obvious that reading examples plucked from the top of internet search engine
results reveals how the first line of [one definition of selective mutism](https://selectivemutismcenter.org/whatisselectivemutism/).
Anyone capable of basic reading comprehension may bear witness to how this
"aide organization" informs adults seeking help that they have no place in these
discussions, yet a quick poll in active autistic adult discussions online
would reveal how much farther reaching this issue of a lacking platform for
an open exchange of ideas reaches.

Shocking levels of self harm are consistently reported, supported by
[one recent analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33433599/) revealing that
autistics were 3-10 times more likely to commit suicide (depending on the
gender, comorbid conditions, etc. reported) even in a country consistently
reported as one of the [happiest populations on the planet](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/06/worlds-happiest-countries-denmark-finland-norway/619299/).
This is no wonder given the [dearth of opportunity](https://www.autism.org.uk/what-we-do/news/new-data-on-the-autism-employment-gap)
presented to autistic people in general, even in the country that birthed
some of the earliest activist communities working to enact change on behalf of
autistic people.

There is much complexity and variation to consider when addressing human
neurology.  We have only begun to scratch the surface of mastery of the secrets
to understanding the naturally ocurring diversity of these organically formed
wiring plans.  Defining and supporting identification of anyone adversely
affected by bigotry in the simplest terms possible could benefit many going
unsupported simply due to gatekeeping and unrecognised bias entrenched in
systems built upon foundations of fear and hate.  We are desparately in need of
broad support of simple differences and the power held through honoring variance
over mythical definitions of normal.  Inclusion, after all, requires that the
work required of ableds to accommodate those with disabilitiess be done ahead of
their arrival (or its just more free labor being required of those already at a
disadvantage).  Barring negotiation of personally unique accommodating options,
welcome is an empty word otherwise.

So, in the spirit of promoting the right to autonomy, communication, and freedom
I want to share a simplified diagnostic criteria which resonated personally in
the hope of continuing the conversation.  See [original video from @erikaheidewald](https://twitter.com/sexylifecoach/status/1388553174051696643)
positing her suggestion, essentially:


 * Can you instinctively intuit social hierarchy and have you always been able to do so?

 * Can you truly feel (vs. see or learn) social status in the subtext of communication?

 If not, you're autistic.



 * Can you dissect and think critically about social constructs in the abstract?

 If not, you're neurotypical.



 If both, you're allistic neurodivergent (e.g. the strongest possible allies to
autistics when informed, or the worst oppressors when reinforcing biased systems
via gaslighting).
