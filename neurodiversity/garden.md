Sensory Garden
==============

Engaging senses, both individually and in combination, in ways one may not usually encounter

Examples of sensory gardens in a recent cursory internet search were focused on
containers or small plots, schools adopting them and private patio experience
were common themes.  My vision is much more grand.  Instead of choosing one or
two of the recommendations below, I rise to the challenge of incorporating as
many as possible into a single therapeutic facility:

```
Cooling Pools
Scented Flowers
Stepping Stones  (across water)
Soothing Colors
Welcome Wildlife
Edible Crops
Texture and Sound  (bamboo)
Wind Chimes
Paved Plantings  (interrupted lines)
Corten Steel  (water features)
Discovery Pathways  (touchable plants)
Rose Framing  (bordering stairs)
Smooth and Soft  (lamb's ear, etc.)
Shaded Benches
Reflecting Light  (mirrors, fixtures)
All Green  (depth of singularity)
Carnival of Color  (bright bloom variety)
```


Calming or Stimulating
----------------------

Design decisions for the garden complex should consider all of one's senses:

```
Sight
Smell
Sound
Taste
Touch
Transpersonal
```

Regions or focus areas within the complex should incoporate indigenous wisdom
and native plants wherever possible:

```
Bee Apairy  (focused on fertilization of gardens)
Bouldering Wall  (native property feature)
Deprivation Nooks  (isolation and quiet)
Edible Growth  (vertical gardening, composting)
Meditation Hall  (open air studio, central raised dais)
Raked Rock  (sourcing on site likely in CO)
Tropical Tunnel  (orchard and lush understory)
Wetland Walk  (linked from tunnel to outside via pond)
```


Accessibility Concerns
----------------------

Foremost in my understanding of universal design (e.g. planning for inclusion
and access up front) is the need to weigh these considerations at every turn:

```
Isolation of Extremes  (loud v. quiet, busy v. calm, still vs. mobile, wet v. dry)
Mobility Devices  (encourage use of wheelchairs, canes, walkers, etc.)
Tours and Education  (accommodations for disabled visitors; sight, sound, intellect)
```


Community Involvement
---------------------

Gardens thrive when tended and many hands make light work.  Support through
varying roles is needed:

```
Direct Contribution  (money to pay invoices)
Guest Speakers/Artists  (installations and workshops)
Land Acknowledgement  (https://native-land.ca/)
Neurodivergent Activism  (nihil de nobis sine nobis)
Partner Organizations  (mutual aid network)
Public Engagement  (outreach and education)
Self-Guided Tours  (signage, audio, video)
Volunteer Opportunities  (landscaping, maintenance, facilitation)
```
