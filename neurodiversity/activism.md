Wrong Template
--------------

Over the last handful of years my struggle to define and obtain help I need
addressing challenges specific to socially exacerbated disability exploded into
epic proportion.  Allistic allopathic medical practitioners bullied and cajoled
with ableism and derision of my plebian pathos.  When lucky enough to afford the
splurge, well intended naturopathic and body work acted as salve or poultice,
symptom specific and lacking necessary overarching perspective.  I too was
lacking much needed perspective in having gone undiagnosed for more than forty
years, and scrambling to maintain the house we were just barely affording in
personally tragic years leading up to the horrors of the pandemic (which too
many of us know all too well).

I do my homework and arrive prepared for interviews yet only very rarely depart
with a sense of having been helped vs. dealt with, tolerated.  Each specialist
defers to another and all collectively avoid accountability behind the banner of
a business.  Nowhere to be found is support for navigating bewildering and ever
changing rulesets and protocols for how to avoid bankruptcy while securing
desperately needed care.  Nobody is assigned the role of concierge, a case
worker, a fimiliar who, also familiar with the medical industrial complex,
guides one toward relief....  This role, I am told, does not exist.  It is not a
benefit one may obtain.  Only, youtube videos from Amsterdam describe weekly
visits with assistants aiding in planning the week ahead and my father had such
a thing while recovering from brain surgery, so it would appear that it does
indeed exist but it simply is not going to get coded by a clinic near you any
time soon.

I am not broken;  I have been broken down by oppressors.


Peer Pressure
-------------

Where it wasn't difficulty accessing benefits attached to the jobs where I've
struggled more with each passing year to keep pace and almost never getting
peers to buy in with even the most simple of accomodations, it was both implicit
and explicit bias preventing the slightest glimmer of a chance at truly
satisfying and fulfilling work which afforded a roof, meals, and healthcare.
I hit all of my early career goals by the age of 40.  White privilege was the
only thing tipping scales in my favor, but I didn't know that at the time.
Attempts at pushing through to the next level without knowing how to navigate
the hurdles inherent to autism broke me.  I've only been able to hold pace with
about 10-20% of my 40 year old capacity during this forty-fifth year.  My
recovery from burnout has hinged on discovering people like me online.  The
disability and activist communities adjacent to "autism advocacy" held open
the flood gates and allowed me to snatch a roughly sketched map of the
landscape throughout pandemic year one (having cut my teeth on How to Twitter
while ranting in support of BLM protests since Juneteenth 2020).

Organizations flooding media outlets with propaganda vilifying autistic people,
silencing and othering ~2-4% of everyone we see, is business as usual lately.
Scaremongering triggered parents with assumptions proven false decades ago,
headlines lately report on an "epidemic of autism" befalling our country at the
behest of organizations spending only tiny slivers of operating budgets on
initiatives guided by autistic people for autistic people.  They flood media
streams pumping eugenics and hatred.  The true epidemic is in their treatment of
traumatized children, yielding traumatized adults an order of magnitude more
likely to meet the end of their lives in suicide, using the only purported
therapy for so many which has been recognized as torture the world over when
applied to other populations.  Compliance to the narrow limits of neurotypical
standards must not continue.

Nothing about us without us!
