=================

Did the group being spoken about have representation?

I Stand with Nonspeakers
------------------------

[Nonspeaking autistics](./glossary.md#nonspeaker) have voices to promote.
Many of them have profound messages to share, but too often face limitations in
lacking patience and understanding of [AAC](./glossary.md#AAC) (technology
which restores agency and sharing of ideas to many previously denied the basic
human right of communication).  The intersections of autistic populations cross
all nations and skin colors and genders and socio-economic status.  People who
identify with multiple marginalized groups should be centered at every
opportunity.  Those who hate us have many different claims to their bigotry and
malice but it usually just boils down to being different than their idealized
impossible state.  Coming together to name and describe our experiences via
common understanding sheds new light for all involved and holds the potential to
change our collective futures based on wisdom gleaned from shared experience.
Organization and solidarity are essential in demanding equal rights and access.

Social disability is not determined by intelligence, capability, or level of
effort.


Honoring Two Spirits
--------------------

Indigenous peoples share tales of those who embodied more than just masculine
or feminine guise.  In recent decades two-spirit was adopted as a pan-tribal
term to describe these cultural phenomena.  The warmth in these conversations
is something for which I long in a visceral way; to speak openly without fear
of rejection or abuse within my own personal networks regarding ideas outside
colonial definitions of normal behavior.  Daily confrontation over defining
terminology hardly ever gives way to actual work beyond level setting in recent
recollection.

I have always felt more at home in a gaggle of girl talk than male locker room
banter.  In truth, I have always been more warmly welcomed and at ease in
feminine company.  Macho jocularity and posturing have never made much sense from
my perspective, being primarily rooted in exclusion and bias, insofar as one
might consider anything a way of being.  Only the altruism, providing, and
protective states within machismo resonate personally.  Learning recently of
its roots in colonialism only serves to further distance me from that space
during this era of protest and moving forward.

I will not accept any indigenous labeling.  It was made for indigenous use.


Black Lives Matter
------------------

Members of mutiple marginalized groups are even more commonly overlooked and
actively oppressed under modern capitalism.  Yes, we are all (as a class of
socially disabled autistics) overdue even footing, yet this compounds and gets
magnified by implicit and explicit bias via each additional minority or
disability with which one identifies (knowingly or not -- e.g. I have seen my
own access limited by being autistic, even before I knew I was, having looked
deeply through personal journals and memories post late life diagnosis).

Many parallels are drawn by sophomoric activists wishing to do good and/or
antagonistic agents looking to reinforce damaging stereotypes, e.g. white people
drawing analogies between the struggles Black people and other minority groups
face.  Simply put, if one doesn't identify with a particular minority group they
have no business appropriating examples owned by the misrepresented minority
when attempting to illustrate their own position.  A preferred option: use
positions of privilege to promote voices from members of that minority.  Hold
fast to the "nothing about us without us" ethos in knowing when to yield the
floor.

Only through solidarity do we break bonds of oppression.
