Reign of Shame
--------------

I've been racing to adapt to unrealistic expectations over four decades, simply
owing to not knowing any better.  Poorly understood invisible disabilities are
ever present, but outreach and compassion worthy of those plights lacking.

Childhood sexual abuse at the hands of a barely mature predator who moved to the
house at the end of the block one summer led to neglect because I couldn't
possibly mean the horrible things I was saying about him or how he involved my
infant sister in his debauchery.  Absent body hair, but insatiably curious
about the changes I was already feeling taking place, I fell prey to gaslighting
while seeking advice.

I have always enjoyed riding bikes immensely.  My brother kicked a skateboard
under my bike wheels on a lark one summer day, sending me reeling.  On another
occasion he blacked my eye to turn me away instead of explaining in terms I
understood why it would be better for me not to tag along with his friends who
seemed to be accepting of my company otherwise.

Arrival at junior high school had me equal parts terrified and titillated.  I
now had the freedom to move between classrooms without supervision.  This had
the unfortunate correlary of the bullies also being unsupervised as they bashed
my shoulder while passing by hurling insults.  My brother never stepped in, but
somehow everyone hitting me referred to the fact that I was his little brother.
I wasn't allowed my own identity, nor did I have any protection from the
unchosen association that had spread throughout our social networks.

Even the track coach was in on it.  I eagerly awaited cross country season in
order to test my skill and stamina in ways my father had in his youth.  When I
reported shin splints from laps over hard pack I was told to suck it up or quit
because everyone felt the same way.  I could barely walk by the time I ended up
yielding weeks later (but it was all in my head).

During high school I was able to assert a loose affiliation with like minded
peers.  The problem I was already recognizing was that I was the only one
reaching out to plan activities like hikes or lounging in cafes.  These calls
weren't coming my way unless I inserted myself into the conversations.

Summers during college were spent toiling as 2nd to a general contractor and
property maintenance contractor.  His eyes were more often on my legs than the
road as we travelled between sites.  At least 3 different times while swapping
tools from the trailer he asked me to shower with him.  It was the only job I
applied to which responded with any interest beyond reimbursement schemes.

Later I did secure a job on a construction site and saved as much overtime pay
as I could physically sustain for one summer.  From the foreman (who explained
the need to shoot intraveinous drugs between toes to avoid detection) to the
pairing I was assigned for hanging heavy metal from the rafters while teetering
atop a 40 foot lift (who confessed 8-balls and 12 packs as his preferred
breakfast), I was harassed relentlessly.  One example was the loose rigging that
had been left on top of our previous days' work site before I was instructed to
shake them all vigorously to validate proper tightening of the bolts.  My nose
was broken and I was refused medical treatment at the on-site medical office.
Laughter rang out as I quit and walked off site.

My fiancee in college, a month before her graduation, announced she didn't love
me any more and that she would move home at the end of the term.  We had been
paying deposits and planning a celebration....  No excuses or explanation were
offered, I just didn't get to be in that relationship any more, after four years
of devoted and loving servitude.

My boyfriend the next year offered me an ultimatum: declare myself gay and
denounce any desire for women to maintain the relationship, or maintain my out
bi status without him.  It was a cold and lonely walk of shame that morning, but
the added experience with varying body parts had only reinforced my self
identification as residing smack in the middle of the scale between homo and
hetero norms.

I moved across the country, to a place I had zero desire to live, in support of
a wife who never did obtain that masters degree during our 7 year marriage.  I
solely worked to support the household while awaiting my chance to focus on
studies supported by employment secured with her fancy new credentials.  At
least I got to experience a lack of daylight savings time changes that year.

We moved across the country again after waiting out the lease in a hostile
desert landscape, seeking fresh perspective in a place where several old friends
from our high school lunch bunch had settled to raise families of their own.
Indulgence in partying held much more attention than maintaining gainful employ
the remaining years before I sought divorce.

I faced sexual abuse from one of the people I thought was a close friend.  His
own struggling relationship saved by lies I was made to carry in silence.  The
word NO got ignored, more gaslighting and direct manipulation to get in my pants
at every opportunity, shunned when I wasn't in the mood or otherwise distracted.

I found out job benefits only provide a mental health starter pack of a half
dozen hour long sessions with a counselor (when they provided any at all).  I
lost jobs because nobody was willing to examine my distress while I was bringing
it to them in safe and healthy ways, the ways their orientations say to do it.
All of the "Why don't you just...?" still ring in my ears.  Never aggressive
enough to get my needs heard, yet way too much over the top once they had no
choice but to attend to my carefully chosen words, discarded the moment an
inconvenient and unimpeachable truth was aired.

I helped my most recent partner move and buy her first house and supported her
through the difficulties of late lives and deaths of both her parents.  It took
6 months to get her to read even a single book about a topic that had upended my
entire outlook on life.  She disowned her sisters over lack of support, but near
the end she communicated with them more often than with me.  She cut me out of
most of her daily life without any explanation, yet still took any benefit I
offered, begging patience as she worked stuff out on her own.

After years of loose affiliation with intellectual and developmental disability
workers and volunteering with some of their clients I began to identify as
autistic.  I lost jobs because nobody was willing to provide accomodations.
Even after submitting myself to official diagnosis and paying out of pocket for
those and related psychiatric and counseling sessions, the best I was able to
garner with full disclosure was denial due to favoritism (except on the two
isolated occasions they [vaunted](./glossary.md#vaunt) while completely missing
the lesson that these were to be process changes affecting every time the issue
came up during a standard work day interaction).


Ill Fit
-------

My medical coverage changed a dozen times within the span of a couple years and
most of the care I received was not covered.  I'm required by law to bear the
expense of insuring my health against the profits generated by a system doing
more to actively harm than help me.  Both of my last two primary care physicians
ignored my pleas for help resolving pain.  At the peak of my distress I was
railroaded with two improper psychiatric diagnoses by an internist with zero
psychiatric or psychological credentials supporting their medical record notes.
They never once responded to my demands to have those records purged.

My retina specialist called me aggressive just after updating, and presumably
reading the most recent infammatory entry in my medical record.  She redirected
and ignored direct questions, forcing her agenda despite clear up front
messaging about my intent for my first visit in over 5 years (which every single
staffer I encountered took time to point out).  I was obviously suffering
sensory overload, yet *I* was eagerly labeled the aggressor.  When challenged,
she could not explain how I had behaved aggressively, she merely repeated her
label attribution by exclaiming "You're being aggressive!".  She signalled
another staffer to lurk in the doorway without introduction and corroborate her
position; more notes supporting foregone conclusions.

Some time later I had to fire my counselor, a late diagnosed autistic, because
the moment I felt comfortable enough to share honest expression I was shut down.
She reported her own sensory overload (despite the meeting being facilitated
remotely via video conference tooling, e.g. volume controls at her fingertips)
and piled on demands for compliant behavior (or else negative notes would go in
my record).  Mind you, I was not disrespecting or besmirching anyone at the
time, I was simply expressing with vehemence how broken support systems were
regarding my own needs.

Carceral systems (not limited to criminal justice, medical complex, psychology)
have always put me off with their transparent duplicity.  The whole mess reeks
of "do as I say not as I do".  We are beholden to those very systems for any
chance at relief from the self same problems that any providing them proliferate
during their wanton manipulation of our autonomy or environment.  Compliance
does not equate to better treatment.  It makes it easier for providers to
continue rushing past real and complex problems with ready-made yet ill-fit
solutions to symptoms.  It makes it easier to describe one as a monster when
they cannot comply.  Addiction, poor diet, lacking exercise, houselessness, etc.
are not the problems they are made out to be in popular media.  They are the
symptoms of oppression.  These systems were built for the benefit of few and
dominion over the rest.

I see no way beyond this for anyone outside of solidarity in opposition.
