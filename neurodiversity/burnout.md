Loss of Control
---------------

Just as I started to relax into the world of adulting, universal power reared
up to remind this fortysomething about impermanence.  I have worked within
networking and web application technology spaces since the turn of the century,
but couldn't seem to produce at anything like the speed of my peers.  Often, and
especially since turning 40, I've had to "volunteer" most of my free time just
to keep apace of peers and meet ever more unreasonable or non-negotiable terms
of employment.  I could not figure out what I was doing wrong, how I was missing
the mark.  I was following the same advice, learning from the same people....

My partner has been quick to remind me about her discomfort with the frequency
of inevitable job changes in my field (I too would prefer stable long term
funding and have actually transitioned less often than peers throughout my
career).  I count only a single reporting manager who fostered my growth in any
mutually acknowledged way over more than two decades spent actively seeking
mentorship.  All others were gatekeepers, [shibboleth](./glossary.md#shibboleth)
holders, pushing their own agenda while ignoring and demanding ever more from
reports.  Frankly speaking, anyone asking a team member to "socialize
information" among the team is enforcing ableism.  Day by day, I witness more
people abdicate their basic human responsibility in similar ways. The more of it
I see, largely with the help of amazing activist communities on social media,
the more I feel compelled to scream into the void lest I ruffle any feathers
with my "aggression" (e.g. overwhelming distress).

Over the late 2010s I came to self-identify as probably, most likely, don't
want to do anything like appropriate, autistic.  By the time I fumbled through
enough conversations intended to open conversation and discovery taken as
outright rage filled tirades, I was forced into choosing between subterfuge or
suffering silently.  I own this as someone who gets shut down more often than
having their queries answered by supportive and open minded information seekers
ready to collaborate.  Once solidarity with the #BlackLivesMatter movement
landed undeniably worldwide during a 2020 northern-hemispheric summer filled
with protest all was laid bare.  The hate-feuled underpinnings of this failed
social experiment once known as America the Great demands silence from anyone
who passes as a white/male/cis/straight person.  With this knowledge, silence
is violence.

For some reason, literally asking for medical leave and help sorting out
obvious imbalance in perceptions and expectations, wasn't acceptable.  The
systems I was maintaining and expanding, using methods contrary to *every*
recommendation from team member contributors, for the benefit of the defunct
Innovation Force leadership at a major health insurance provider were paltry
examples of what we could have built had emphasis been placed on intersectional
inclusion over cross-departmental intra-company leverage.  I blew my top upon
learning directly from HR leadership that the (3rd in a row) manager to whom I'd
reported handfuls of unanswered concerns and complaints never once forwarded or
investigated pleas for help resolving ongoing harassment.  Only my use of
anonymous tip lines provoked any positive change during my tenure there.

A finely honed interview engine resulted next in what would appear to most as a
great opportunity with a booming subcontractor in federal health care web
applications months later.  Their position was that both of the times they
provided requested accomodations they were going above and beyond the call of
duty.  My reminder that some accomodations require continual effort and that my
recently confirmed diagnosis secured my right to claim effort due was not taken
well.  Cries of favoritism resounded.  They had done nothing at all in terms of
neurodiversity planning or engagement until I introduced the ideas of employee
resource groups and internal advocacy and support of marginalized groups.  What
they demanded was full time work toward at least two separate sets of roles and
responsibilities simultaneously; as long as I delivered as much code as peers
they would "let me" continue.  I ended up resigning from that job on two
separate occasions with a total of three months dedicated to sisyphean struggle.

Discovering myself enmeshed within a terrible burnout without a single ally
available for verbal ventilation was terrifying.  The mere fact that I've been
unable to effectively script new conversations and the only people near are
mixed up in my trauma leaves me little option but bombastic presentation until
I've wrestled with the cognitive dissonance long enough to start gleaning
anything of enduring value from the rubble.

As for what this phenomenon, autistic burnout, looks like when manifest...?  Do
everyone a favor and do a web search if you're unfamiliar.  Strongly supported
[#ActuallyAutistic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ActuallyAutistic '#ActuallyAutistic on Twitter')
and [#AutisticPOC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AutisticPOC '#AutisticPOC on Twitter')
activists have already exposed that free labor so be sure to drop a tip, buy a
coffee, and subscribe via whatever links they provide to acknowledge that you
are learning from entrepeneurs and activists who strive daily against white
privilege, bigotry, and insolence just to meet basic needs.  The force
multiplier in facing multiple fronts of marginalization is poorly recognized,
and statistics for that too, are only a search form submission away....


Taking Control
--------------

Demanding rights is not aggression; it is progress toward accountability by a
previously and currently oppressive force.  Using the rights hard won by people
marginalized repeatedly over decades of fighting within the system to provide
rule of law supporting universal truths is not asking too much; it is only one
step toward demonstrating, living by example, the messages typically isolated
within lofty oratory or public children's programming or job postings.  Protest
is not anarchy; it is one of few voices left after politeness politics and tone
policing endeavor to squash protected speech.  Refusing to treat the mythical
"business needs" as collectively more important than basic humane treatment of
"others" is not career suicide; it is breaking down failed social constructs for
the benefit of future generations.  Nobody is less than.  Read that again:
nobody is less than anyone else.

That said, please take a moment to consider the [LISTEN Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7dca7U7GI8).
It provides insight from marginalized people who have too often been ignored.

Any time I made the mistake of speaking openly about my discomfort navigating
bias via social dynamics or new arrivals ruining stable working relationships
I was immediately entrenched in defense of my own behavior instead of unlocking
access to much needed counsel and support.  Emotional flashbacks lock me into
trauma responses after cascades of being cornered and blamed lead to inevitable
implosion.  This yet to be acknowledged torture was almost exclusively because
an overpaid and disconnected executive was bored by our misunderstood pace of
progress and decided adding headcount would solve whatever problem there
remained for his people to work out on their own.  You know ... as a personal or
career growth exercise, right?

It has been messy work.  Imagine trying to overcome these hurdles time and again
for decades without knowing anything about even the most basic essentials for
autistic success....  Simply because I had no way to know without external
advocacy or surviving enough failure to learn things the hard way!

The first time I came out to an employer as autistic the immediate reaction was
a sharp intake of breath and expression of remorse.  I now know better than to
accept that kind of disparagement.  I express that with certainty because my
neurodivergence is nothing short of one shining example of the beautiful
variation in human expression our fragile world hosts.  Disparagement due to
unconscious bias or preference alone will not be tolerated.  I expect no less
from everyone I meet than to continually seek to know better and do better.

Any time I have the spoons, I look forward to advancing this discussion.
