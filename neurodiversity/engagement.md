Getting Involved
================

Both unemployment and suicidality in numbers orders of magnitude beyond those
found in neurotypical populations is common for autistic people


Competition vs. Collaboration
-----------------------------

A sad reality showed a hand written plea for employment from a young autistic
job seeker circulating on LinkedIn recently.  Inspiration porn or inspired job
application?  You decide....

I will say this: I'm weary of capitalism's reach into my living room.  My very
way of being is controlled by others unless I amass a large enough pool of
resources to force my opinion on a less fortunate group.  This, not by choice,
by compulsion having faced unexplained rejection in every forum over decades
of searching for a place I truly fit in and receive much needed support.

While interviewing each of my last few managers one important question was posed
each time which garnered only lies in response:

	How do you foster collaboration over competition within your team?

I say lies because none of those teams focused on building the individuals who
comprised the membership of those juggernauts shipping value biweekly.  Surely,
I'm exaggerating...?  No.  These teams only built more efficient ways to extract
value from many more people for the benefit of ever fewer.  I was fought at
every single step when I raised concerns over accessibility in either product or
process, but I still found ways to build consensus and enact change within those
teams which respected team member needs as well as the mythical business user.
Every single time such organization, driven by the very people providing the
value leveraged by the business, was recognized in my personal history that same
business acted to eliminate a perceived threat rising up (e.g. the axe fell on
my neck instead of good ol' boy incompetents exposed via objective qualitative
measures yet protected socially, illegitimately).

Those same teams had already documented improved outcomes via my advising toward
inclusive practices by the time complaints of the onerous "extra workloads" they
were suffering for "purely theorectical gains" defaulted us back into methods
which easily doubled my personal workload via peer negligence alone.  Instead
of honoring our shared struggle and platforming these examples of successful
inclusion, my very real needs were written off as the cost of doing business.

In each of the jobs I left without a plan for how to continue fulfilling my
budget obligations it was direct response to backstabbing or belligerant peers
which gave rise to any reported conflict.  My quiet consistent pleas for aide
went ignored until repeated once too often.  Any outbursts (surely the most
common aspect these teams would describe of my behavior with revisionist
histories being what they are...) were autistic reactions to people fighting to
obscure meaning, to encode "clever" (e.g. difficult to decipher) solutions, to
flout well tested best practices or the [ADA](https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/ada-guidelines)
and every single protection it stands for regarding digital environments.  Abuse
of power, the bellweather of ensured neglect and exclusion.  Since completing
recent research into the state of autism advocacy I see so much more unmet need
than I ever previously imagined.  These questions remain:  Are there any teams
out there that are actually pursuing this type of help?  Is there such a thing
as a software development team focused on doing right by their customers as
opposed to extracting value from their data...?  Is anyone putting people over
profit (and realizing both)?

Not having tapped into autistic knowledge or received any help on the way there
(i.e. no peers recognized and called out traits or suggestions for consulting
diagnosticians), I have already established a track record as a neurodiversity
activist running throughout my entire career in technology.  Now I choose to
define activism as my primary objective.  Truly unique perspective, not to
mention already highly profesionally accomplished, now accepting offers.


I'm Neurodivergent, Hire Me!
----------------------------

Personal Appraisal:

* loyal and steadfast
* preference for routine
* self-motivated autodidact
* rushing is an anti-workflow
* neurotypical "normal" is ableism
* justice is impossible considering "just us"


* pattern / optimization / naming guru
* active listener with adept in-depth reflection
* systems level perspective w/ ease after orientation
* foundational expertise prerequisite to rapid iteration
* cognitive dissonance declaratively resolved in meta spaces


* automate anything (given time and budget)
* entirely unique perspective (coming out stories)
* double empathy and code switching are native
* people skillz for dayz! (when in spoons)


* without advanced knowledge, responses vary widely
* transitions away from ideas not fully expressed are difficult
* resolute until data proves otherwise, then quick to adapt / update
* deliberate and thorough w/ eyes on intersectionality and human rights
* expert meeting facilitation targeting maximal inclusion
* decades of prior success in widely varying roles


* alarms, deadlines, on-call demands trigger anxiety
* context switches are increasingly expensive as I age
* observation / cataloguing / munging are restive states
* synchronous communication forms by appointment only
* transparency is key to building mutual trust
* text / AAC & remote FTW!  async RULZ


This list, by no means exhaustive, provides a glance into what anyone might
expect while working with me from day to day.  Any questions or concerns will
be easily addressed in conversation;  I wrote with the intention of spurring
thoughtful follow-up.  Generally affable and open, I've found that times I've
been described as aggressive or offputting have almost exclusively followed
overstimulation due to lacking accomodations.  Knowledge gained through recent
networking and research have fleshed out my personal tool chain to the point I
have full confidence in facing any advocacy, software development, or management
responsibility.  The power, as ever, is in the hands of those holding.

What do you say?  Do you see value in what I offer?
