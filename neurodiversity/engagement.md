Getting Involved
================

Both unemployment and suicidality in numbers orders of magnitude beyond those
found in neurotypical populations is common for autistic people

Competition vs. Collaboration
-----------------------------

[A sad reality](https://www.kwch.com/2021/03/15/letter-to-employer-posted-on-linkedin-goes-viral/)
showed a hand written plea for employment from a young autistic job seeker
circulating on LinkedIn recently.  Did it go viral and capture multiple
national network newsrooms because it was inspiration porn?  Or an inspired job
application?  You decide....  I know which one I've seen represented more often
(and it isn't growing any savings accounts).

I will say this: I'm weary of capitalism's reach into my living room.  My very
way of being is controlled by others unless I manage to amass a large enough
pool of resources to force my opinion on a less fortunate group.  This, not by
choice, by compulsion having faced unexplained rejection in every forum over
decades of searching for a place I truly fit in and receive much needed support.
This is a system accepted through silence of privileged working as intended.

While interviewing each of my last few managers one important question was posed
each time which garnered only lies in reply:

	How do you foster collaboration over competition within your team?

I say lies because none of those teams focused on building the individuals who
comprised the membership of juggernauts shipping value biweekly.

Surely, I'm exaggerating...?!  No (I will not accept any further gaslighting).

One case in point was the wide distribution encouraged after a developer on my
sprint team, having obviously mistaken some communication failure as my personal
deficit, sent out an article disparaging "expert beginners" as unknowing
immitators then repeatedly had loud conversation near me about how some people
were clueless to their own imposter behavior....  Nevermind that most of my
clarifying questions were overridden as though I simply hadn't done my homework
the very moment any teammate's "brilliant solution" had any weakness exposed.
He seemed certain we were all fighting over supremacy vs. clawing out a spare
living by leaving everything one has on the playing field for the benefit of the
whole team.  He spoke as though we should all have read from the same page and
come to the same conclusions, his blindness to his own neurotypical white
privilege was truly phenomenal, and the recruitment efforts were dizzying!

These teams only built more efficient ways to extract value from many more
people for the benefit of ever fewer.  I was fought at every single step when I
raised concerns over accessibility in either product or process, but I still
found ways to build consensus and enact change within those teams while showing
respect for team member needs as well as the mythical business user.  Every
single time such organizing, driven by the very people providing the value
leveraged by the business in its imprudent bids to control destiny, was
recognized by the business it acted to eliminate a perceived threat rising up
(e.g.  the axe fell on my neck instead of good ol' boy incompetents plainly
exposed using objective qualitative measures).  When in doubt, kill an odd duck.

The irony is those same teams had already documented improved outcomes via my
advising toward inclusive practices by the time complaints of the onerous "extra
workloads" they were suffering for "purely theorectical gains" defaulted us back
into methods which easily doubled my personal workload via peer negligence
alone.  Instead of honoring our shared struggle and platforming these examples
of successful inclusion and actually employing iterative process, dog fooding,
walking the talk, my very real needs were written off as the cost of doing
business.  Must accellerate ROI!

In each of the jobs I left without a plan for how to continue fulfilling my
budget obligations it was direct response to backstabbing or belligerant peers
which gave rise to any reported conflict.  Without fail my quiet and consistent
pleas for aide accompanied by alternative solutions went ignored until repeated
once too often.  Any outbursts (surely the most common aspect these teams would
describe of my behavior with revisionist histories being what they are...) were
autistic reactions to people fighting to obscure meaning, to encode "clever"
(e.g. difficult to decipher) solutions, to flout well tested best practices or
the [ADA](https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/ada-guidelines) and every
single protection it stands for regarding digital environments.

Abuse of power, the bellweather of ensured neglect and exclusion, is something
I have never been able to abide.  Since completing a recent round of research
into the state of autism advocacy I see so much more unmet need than I ever
previously imagined.  These questions remain:  Are there any teams out there
that are actually pursuing this type of help?  Is there such a thing as a
software development team focused on doing right by their members and customers
as opposed to extracting maximal value from their data...?  Is anyone putting
people over profit (and thereby realizing both)?  Is the role of Chief
Neurodiversity Officer a thing...?

Without having tapped into autistic knowledge or receiving any help with
discovery (i.e. no peers recognized and called out traits or suggestions for
consulting diagnosticians -- if anything I was even more excluded from team
activities after raising the topic over morning coffee) I have already, albeit
accidentally, established a track record as a neurodiversity activist.  Direct
effort applied toward equitable working relationships runs throughout my entire
career in technology.  Today, having found my tribe, I declare my choice to
define activism against bias as my primary objective.  Truly unique perspective,
not to mention profesionally accomplished, now accepting offers.

Personal Appraisal:

* loyal and steadfast
* preference for routine
* self-motivated autodidact
* rushing is an anti-workflow
* neurotypical "normal" is ableism
* justice is impossible when its "just us"

<div></div>

* pattern / optimization / naming guru
* active listener with adept in-depth reflection
* systems level perspective w/ ease after orientation
* foundational expertise prerequisite to rapid iteration
* cognitive dissonance declaratively resolved in meta spaces

<div></div>

* automate anything (given time and budget)
* entirely unique perspective (coming out stories)
* double empathy and code switching natively expressed
* people skills for days (when I have spoons and support)

<div></div>

* without advanced knowledge, responses vary widely
* transitions away from ideas not fully expressed are difficult
* resolute until data proves otherwise, then quick to adapt / update
* deliberate and thorough w/ eyes on intersectionality and human rights
* multimodal meeting facilitation targeting maximal inclusion
* decades of prior success in widely varying roles

<div></div>

* alarms, deadlines, on-call demands trigger dysregulation
* observation / cataloging / munging are restive states
* synchronous communication forms by appointment only
* context switches increasingly expensive as I age
* transparency is key to building mutual trust
* text / AAC & remote FTW!  async RULZ

This list, by no means exhaustive, provides a glance into what anyone might
expect while working with me from day to day.  Any questions or concerns will
be easily addressed in conversation;  I wrote with the intention of spurring
thoughtful follow-up.  Generally affable and open, I've found that times I've
been described as aggressive or offputting have almost exclusively followed
distress and overstimulation due to lacking accomodations.  Knowledge gained
through recent networking and research have fleshed out my personal tool chain
to the point I have full confidence in embracing any roles with advocacy,
software development, or management responsibility.  The power, as ever, is in
the hands of those holding.

What do you say?  Do you see value in what I offer?  Let's discuss!

One would be doing both of us a disservice by reading hidden meaning into
anything written here.  I choose specific words very deliberately to express
