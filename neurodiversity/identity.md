Personal vs. Cultural
---------------------

Modern societies demand tidy labels for efficient and effective grouping and
categorization during debate and application of policy, but as the internet age
continues to provide tooling which may be used to give voice to oppressed people
across the world, we witness surging demands for those labels to be accurately
counted and safeguarded.  As with any miracle of science, this too may be put to
nefarious ends all too easily.  Let's work to counter that....

Casting labels onto others seems to be universally unwelcome behavior, and as
such nobody defines my experience but me.


Binary Limits
-------------

Intensive study and analysis of witnessed behaviors leads me into an often
expansive capacity for feeling the room, almost weather as sense.  I knew more
about microexpressions than any of my public school topics (excepting the fact I
was lucky to have music as part of standard school offerings, and music is often
a refuge and respite for me even still) before I even had a name for these odd
sources of information sharing wrapped in the guise of subconscious behaviors.

It was this hyperobservant status quo which led to my affinity with chameleons.
Any time I felt abused growing up, I'd search the behavior catalog for similar
cases in a desperate effort to stop frustrating everyone.  Blending in to avoid
notice *is* survival for so many.  Behavior *is* language.


Personal Labels
---------------

Gendered pronouns simply are not appropriately applied in my case (e.g.
they/them is actually me, but he/him is allowed as a social compromise given my
assigned gender at birth -- I simply [don't have any spoons](./glossary.md#spoons)
for defending my turf against [TERFs](./glossary.md#TERF) at this point in my
story).

Person first language is not welcome when used to describe me (e.g. I am
autistic vs. I "have autism").

Put simply, if you're using any label and you have neither asked me directly
about the implications of doing so nor been asked by me to do so, you're not
behaving as a very good ally....


Origin Story
------------

The first identity I aligned with was Nordic.  Mother's family Norwegian and
Swedish, Father's Finnish.  I was born into it, but very little tradition
remained beyond a few foods and words and jokes.  In secret I read the eddas
and cast runes seeking personal truths.  A longing to understand a deeper felt
but unspoken connection persisted, mostly dormant.  I never did let go of the
desire to be able to braid a full and fearsome beard....

Alas, bigots and zealots use ancient symbols for childish conceits, making what
remains of that culture, from my perspective, largely inaccessible due to
attached bias and stigma.


To Bi, or Not to Bi
-------------------

As any young gladiator is wont to do, I explored my sexuality among writhing
sweaty masculinity with as much ease as tracing butterfly kisses over every inch
of the divine feminine before succumbing to her beckon.  Charlie the Gladiator
was my high school mascot.  What?!  They didn't behave this way at your
schools ...?  Well, bi beg to differ!

After processing the traumatization that constituted the bulk of my junior high
school experience, I explored myself as a budding flower, replete with both male
and female parts, around the same time as my peers but I felt entirely rushed
into it.  As with any autistic [autodidactic](./glossary.md#autodidact) approach
to learning, I ravenously consumed everything I could find which related, AKA
not much beyond hetero-normative brainwashing or ['zines](./glossary.md#zine)
all in on the G part of LGBT+.  [Bi erasure](./glossary.md#erasure) loomed with
unsettling foreshadowing.

Adventure buddies at the time would rendezvous at tea and coffee houses,
boutique book and toy stores, really anywhere that would patiently host our
rambling, often giggly, sessions of discovery and intrigue.  During one such
occassion I landed on the Kinsey Report, an angel chorus may have been singing.
I don't know, I got pulled into a tunnel.  I was simultaneously and immediately
terrified of being seen with it, laser focused on unearthing its secrets, and
bodily thrilled at the potential lessons lurking within this tome so I wouldn't
have heard the heavenly harmony anyway.  I carried that book with me everywhere
while I worked through its pages, dictionary and travel thesaurus at the ready.
Enthralled by the themes and variations on what moved people into action, I
envisioned myself straddling the midline of the scale and became eager to
discuss, but how!?!  With whom!?!?

And so we arrive at Pride:  rainbows, leather, judgement, and AIDS discourse.
I still didn't know any mentors with lived experience.  My undiagnosed and
unrecognized social disability compounding discovery of tribal knowledge led
me nowhere fast.  Not sure of much, I had by that point decided one thing on my
own, and displayed it prominently on my t-shirt:  It's Not Just A Phase

And it wasn't.  But what was it?


Hard for the Money
------------------

A need for work has always had a way of forcing my world to expand.  Summers
during college were spent toiling as 2nd to a property maintenance / general
contractor.  I learned many of the skills which make it possible for me to
maintain my own home with his detailed tutelage, as well as early forays into
supervision that came in handy on other jobs.  He also introduced me to family
(and detailed what our pride family was while getting in a good laugh at my
expense for failing to see the overloaded covert meaning implied) at the gay
club where we'd lunch between jobs.  It was there that I learned of opportunity
for underaged queers to see live music in the attached underground space which
was unironically eponymous.  Mr. Ken, Handy Man was not just the name of my
employer's business.  He ended up also being infamous for behaving as such with
youth he had been entrusted to guide into queer adulthood.

When he finally picked me up from the 3rd job site after I told him I was very
much in need of food and rest his eyes were more often on my legs than the road.
"So good to have you around." as he grabbed a thigh for a squeeze, "Those
tanned legs look SO good!" and I lock up near total shutdown searching for a way
to say NO without losing my best, and so far only, chance at any level of
personal freedom over the next 3 months....  There were a handful of times
while swapping tools from the trailer in preparation for the next day's
itinerary that he offered up the use of his shower.  Once he even called me back
to drive home my need to shower before we attended teen night at the LGBT
community center which he facilitated.  He "couldn't hear my answer" so I walked
back to repeat myself again directly through the open door only to discover his
naked soapy erection along with his smiling invite to hop through the open
curtain so we could get there even sooner and he could show me around.

I decided I was better off letting my newly discovered peers meet me obviously
right off the job site.  I wasn't going to learn what I needed this way....


Purple and Gold
---------------

My alma mater's song is a lilting sleepy waltz harkening back to colonial days
of old.  At the time of my own attendance there was decidedly more intoxicant
fueled rape culture than those fair songwriters warned us about.  My own list of
easily accessible allegedly consumed windows to fun and discovery may or may not
have included:

	* alchohol
	* caffeine
	* cannabis
	* heroin
	* LSD
	* MDMA
	* opium
	* psylocybin
	* pharmaceuticals

At that university I disc golfed, dance partied, and found myself in the
information systems department of a leading business school as my best play
for a sustainable income source.  Already at this stage I had discovered and
demonstrated a crude mastery over building structure into my life as crutches
for lacking social constructs.  Addiction, codependence, and recognition of
the implications of pursuing those paths, too.  I saw very clearly the link
between risky behavior and the razor edge separating appearances of health from
those called disease.

I also learned what it is to really sing in harmony and reverberate with my
whole body in mighty unison under precise direction.  I attended master classes
with internationally touring jazz singers, played the part of a haunted statue
in an opera and thumped out bass lines in an [a cappella](./glossary.md#a-capella)
group between concert choir sets.  It was there, doing what I most loved, that I
first experienced autistic burnout without recognizing it.  Nobody in my life
used the A word beyond passing curiosity, so how could I?

Go Bears!


Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
---------------

Once there was this boy who ....  nailed the affect in that Crash Test Dummies
song during karaoke.  Nobody in the bar seemed to think so, which was entirely
depressing as a recent music school graduate and technology professional.  One
guy reached out, he asked if I partied.  I said "Yeah, sure. You?" so he
followed with an invite to his place.  He said he "didn't have much but was
willing to share".  This was the night I discovered what that first question
really meant coming from a strange man in a bar.

OK, the truth is I knew it when we left the bar in the sense that scenes in tale
after tale describe the debauchery and I read subtext all too well.  I was so
desperate for company around that time I honestly didn't see much harm in the
potential risks inherent in whoring myself to a complete stranger over being
able to resolve intense experiential curiosity and maybe for a moment feel
anything but numb.  The $7 orange juices at the strip club down the block from
the first apartment I had totally on my own just weren't cutting it for me.  I
told myself it was for the science.  I can still see details of that room when
my mind wanders.  The part that really and truly got me down that night...?
He was so devoid of love.  I went more to spy on possible futures than I ever
felt compelled by using drugs or sharing his life.  After settling my freebase
account and a bit of polite conversation I walked out almost as shattered as
that last glimpse of his eyes told me he was over losing a new friend.

I could still become him according to a recent psychological profile.


Repetition and Learning
-----------------------

Most binaries I encounter, even to this day, just don't compute.  The rigid
simplistic structure, just so ... empty.  Questions posed authoritatively are
too often bandied about, filled half full with thoughtless ableism and topped
off with assumptive triggers and left to speak for myriad voices as though they
ever could have.  There is poetry in well written prose, most only looking to
couplets and rhyme.

Masculine expression, feminine perception.  I haven't seen anything like that on
any list of gender alternatives, even the most woke.  Others report seeing me as
an overly aggressive white male.  My senses tell me I'm the one being beaten
into submission repeatedly on top of incessant tone policing.  My mind won't
allow me access if I am overwhelmed.  It seems to act with protective short
circuits, turning the potential for meltdowns into shutdowns (less external
behavioral impact, at least, even if they each exact heavy tolls).  I've been
able to cobble together a multi-decade career without knowing I was making
withdrawals from an interest free account, but now I'm overdrawn.

The times in my life I've felt struck by the pejorative "man up!" or bristled
at being told I was not manly enough stand out frequently in my recall.  I have
never quite known how I should express my feelings in a way that doesn't
immediately catch fire during these events.  It was only recently I came to the
realization that I wasn't offended at the attacks on some non-existent manhood
nearly as much as the ever-present assumption I ever projected that identity
into the world in the first place.

I've got the legs for dresses and heels.  Even college boys have hurled catcalls
before facial hair came into focus and they threatened violence.  I also clean
up and fill out a tux pretty well.  So, why not both, or neither?
